# Phoenix Dark Pink

This is a port of the Phoenix Dark Pink theme I found through Sublime
Text 2's package control plugin. It's a bit rough, but seems
functional for me.

I will likely update it, focusing on fixing it for Lisp, Elisp,
Clojure, Javascript, CoffeeScript (ew), Ruby, Rails and various
shells.

## Screenshot

Here's an example of the theme displaying Javascript, Ruby (Rails),
Elisp and Clojure.
